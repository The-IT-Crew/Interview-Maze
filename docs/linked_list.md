## Questions

1. > Write a code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. Can you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed? `#medium` [code: []()]

2. > Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list. [code: []()]

3. > Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e. any node but the first and last node is not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node. [code: []()]
```
Example-
I/P:	the node c from the linked list 
        a->b->c->d->e->f
O/P:	nothing is returned, but the new 
        linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f
```

4. > Implement a function to check if a list is a palindrome or not. `#easy` [code: []()]

5. > Given a sorted linked list of distinct nodes (no two nodes have the same data) and an integer X. Count distinct triplets in the list that sum up to a given integer X. (the Linked List can be sorted in any order). Can you do this in O(n2) complexity? `#medium` [code: []()]
```
Example -
I/P:	LinkedList: 1->2->4->5->6->8->9
        X = 17
O/P:	2
Explanation - Distinct triplets are (2, 6, 9) and (4, 5, 8) which have a sum equal to X i.e 17.
```

6. > Given two single linked lists that intersects at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non cyclical. For example A = 3->7->8->10 and B = 99->1->8->10, return the node with value 8. In this example, assumes nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects. Do this in O(M+N) time, where M and N are the lengths of the lists, and in constant space. `#medium` [code: [c++](https://github.com/The-IT-Crew/Interview-Maze/blob/main/Problem%20Solving/linked%20list/intersecting_point.cpp)]
