## Questions

1. > Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6]. Follow-up: what if you can't use division? `#hard`

2. > Given a string, find the length of the smallest window that contains every distinct character. Characters may appear more than once in the window. For example, given "jiujitsu", you should return 5, corresponding to the final five letters. `#medium` [code: [c++](https://github.com/The-IT-Crew/Interview-Maze/blob/main/Problem%20Solving/miscellaneous/smallest_window.cpp)]
