1. > Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6]. Follow-up: what if you can't use division? `#hard`

2. > Given a string, find the length of the smallest window that contains every distinct character. Characters may appear more than once in the window. For example, given "jiujitsu", you should return 5, corresponding to the final five letters. `#medium` [code: [c++](https://github.com/The-IT-Crew/Interview-Maze/blob/main/Problem%20Solving/miscellaneous/smallest_window.cpp)]

4. > There are N people numbered from 0 to N-1, playing a game. The k'th persion is assigned to the letter S[k]. At the beginning 0'th persion sends a message, consisting a single character S[0] to the A[0]'th persion. When the k'th persion receives the message, they append their letter S[k] to the message and forward it to A[k]. The game ends when the 0'th persion receives the message. Find the final message. Example: given S='cdeo' and A=[3,2,0,1], your function should return 'code'. At the beginning, the 0'th persion sends a message 'c' to the 3rd persion. Next, the 3rd persion forwards the message 'co' to the 1'st persion. After that the 1st persion forwards the message 'cod' to the 2'nd persion. After appending the letter 'e' to it, the 2'nd persion forward it to the 0'th persion. The final message, received by 0'th persion is 'code'. `#medium` [code: [c++]()]

5. > Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well. For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3. `#hard` [code: [c++]()]
